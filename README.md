Ginkgo Data
-----------

This repository contains performance data for the
[Ginkgo library](https://github.com/ginkgo-project/ginkgo).
The performance data hosted in this repository is regularly updated to reflect
the latest version of the library via the CI system. To interactively generate
different visualizations of the data collected here, check out
[Ginkgo Performance Explorer](https://ginkgo-project.github.io/gpe).

## License

TBD: (Don't do anything commercial with the data until then. Using it for
research is fine.)
